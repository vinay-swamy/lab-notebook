# Lab Notebook

## 09-09-2021(Thursday)
Right now my main focus is (at a high level) understanding how attention and transformers work in language models. I'm doign this by:

- reading the goodfellow deeplearning textbook
- blogposts()

Next, I'm going to try and figure out how to use pytorch

- have read through most of the code for gMVP. Trying to run the initial data generation scripts, but missing input files. Rest of lab has not been super reponsive 
- I did find some processed files elsewhere on the `/data` drive ( in `hz**/protein/tf` ), that I might be able to use in the mean time to get something up and running 
- debating on whether or not to talk to yufeng about the lack of communication/documentation on the project.
